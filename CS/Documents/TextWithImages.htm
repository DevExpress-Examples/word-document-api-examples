men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes right– all that falls
to them is so much gain–all their geese are swans–all their cards are
trumps–toss them which way you will, they will always, like poor puss, alight
upon their legs, and only move on so much the faster. The world may very likely
not always think of them as they think of themselves, but what care they for
the world? What can it know about the matter?<b><i> </i></b></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:#161616'>One of
these lucky beings was neighbor Hans. Seven long years he had worked hard for
his master. At last he said, ’Master, my time is up; I must go home and see my
poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages and let me go.’ And the master
said, ’You have been a faithful and good servant, Hans, so your pay shall be
handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump of silver as big as his head. Hans took out
his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it, threw it over his
shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards.  As he went lazily on, dragging
one foot after another, a man came in sight, trotting gaily along on a capital
horse. ’Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ’what a fine thing it is to ride on horseback!
There he sits as easy and happy as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside;
he trips against no stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows
how.’ Hans did not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said,
’Well, friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ’Ah!’ said he, ’I have this load to
carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up my
head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ’What do you say of making
an exchange?’ said the horseman. ’I will give you my horse, and you shall give
me the silver; which will save you a great deal of trouble in carrying such a
heavy load about with you.’ ’With all my heart,’ said Hans: ’but as you are so
kind to me, I must tell you one thing–you will have a weary task to draw that
silver about with you.’ However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped
Hans up, gave him the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and
said, ’When you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry
“Jip!&quot;’</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:#161616'>Hans
was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his elbows,
turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one minute
whistling a merry tune, and another singing,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=poet><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:#161616'>’No care and no sorrow, <br>
A fig for the morrow!<br>
We’ll laugh and be merry, <br>
Sing neigh down derry!’</span></i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:#161616'>After
a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he smacked his lips
and cried ’Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and before Hans knew what he
was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his back by the road-side. His horse
would have ran off, if a shepherd who was coming by, driving a cow, had not
stopped it. Hans soon came to himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly
vexed, and said to the shepherd, ’This riding is no joke, when a man has the
luck to get upon a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would
break his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great
deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has spoiled my
best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells not very like a
nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that cow–keep good company,
and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day, into the bargain. What would I
give to have such a prize?’ ’Well,’ said the shepherd, ’if you are so fond of
her, I will change my cow for your horse; I like to do good to my neighbors,
even though I lose by it myself.’ ’Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ’What a noble
heart that good man has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse,
wished Hans and the cow good morning, and away he rode.</span></p>

brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and then drove off
his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky one. ’If I have only a
piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be able to get that), I can,
whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with it; and when I am thirsty I can
milk my cow and drink the milk: and what can I wish for more?’ When he came to
an inn, he halted, ate up all his bread, and gave away his last penny for a
glass of beer. When he had rested himself he set off again, driving his cow
towards his mother’s village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came
on, till at last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more
than an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue clave
to the roof of his mouth. ’I can find a cure for this,’ thought he; ’now I will
milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the stump of a tree, and
held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop was to be had. Who would
have thought that this cow, which was to bring him milk and butter and cheese,
was all that time utterly dry? Hans had not thought of looking to that.</span></p>

he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very clumsily, the
uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at last gave him such a
kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he lay a long while senseless.
Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a pig in a wheelbarrow. ’What is the
matter with you, my man?’ said the butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him
what had happened, how he was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the
cow was dry too. Then the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ’There,
drink and refresh yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she
is an old beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ’Alas, alas!’ said
Hans, ’who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and give me
only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate cow-beef; it
is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now –like that fat gentleman you
are driving along at his ease–one could do something with it; it would at any
rate make sausages.’ ’Well,’ said the butcher, ’I don’t like to say no, when
one is asked to do a kind, neighborly thing. To please you I will change, and
give you my fine fat pig for the cow.’ ’Heaven reward you for your kindness and
self-denial!’ said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off
the wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to its
leg.</span></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Segoe UI",sans-serif;color:#161616'>So on
he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met with some
misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all. For a while he
watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang up and danced for joy,
and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven, with tears in his eyes, for
its kindness in taking away his only plague, the ugly heavy stone. ’How happy
am I!’ cried he; ’nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he got with a light
heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till he reached his mother’s
house, and told her how very easy the road to good luck was.</span></p>
